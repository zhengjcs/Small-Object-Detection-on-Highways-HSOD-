# Small-Object-Detection-on-Highways-HSOD-

Our new dataset is acquired from highway cameras. The images contain common highway environments, such as bridges and tunnels, and are collected in the visible natural light spectrum. We care about the safety problem caused by objects such as plastic bags(PB), boxes(BX) and barricades(BA) on the highways. Therefore, we select a large number of images and label the objects of concern. The dataset has a total of 931 images and 1458 instances, of which there are 700 small objects, 527 medium objects and 231 large objects. In the comparison with the two public datasets PASCAL VOC 2007 and MSCOCO 2017 it can be seen that our proposed dataset has a majority of small objects, close to 50%.\\
